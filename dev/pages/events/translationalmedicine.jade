        | Translational medicine is 
        a(href='https://www.ucsf.edu/about/translational-medicine', target='_blank') the conversion of scientific discovery into health improvement, 
        | bringing the "bench to bedside" by innovating new cures, integrating these techniques into practice, and inspiring future doctors and scientists to always work towards patient centered clinical applications.
      h5
        | Translational Medicine Day (TMD) will bridge the discussions occurring in San Diego’s vibrant and expansive research community with the future of cutting edge healthcare. TMD will gather students, professors, and industry together to enhance the heart of this discussion. The event will host speakers, panels, medical device tours, industry device demonstrations, and clinical bioengineering posters that seek to demonstrate the potential of translational research in medicine and also provide students a look into opportunities to contribute to the field in the future.

        | As advances in sequencing technology have allowed patients to have access to their own genetic information, how does this information impact them? How does a patient translate this information into something useful? Dr. 
        b Cinnamon Bloss
        | , who is currently an assistant professor in the Department of Psychiatry can help answer these questions as her research focuses on the individual and societal impacts of emerging biomedical technologies. Some of her major projects include direct-to-consumer genomics, clinical genome sequencing, biosensing and mobile health, and personal health big data. Prior to joining UCSD, Dr. Bloss was the Director of Social Sciences and Bioethics at the Scripps Translational Science Institute.
