My academic interests are primarily in anything cancer-related, robot-related, and things that can cause explosions of some kind. I'm a swimmer, martial artist, gamer, musician, cook, graphic designer, and sarcasm connoisseur. If you have any questions about BMES, I'll try, but I'm probably better at answering anything Publicity/Design related. I'm traught to meet you, so I hope I can whelm you with my help. Feel the aster!",
