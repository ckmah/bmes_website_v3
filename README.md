# BMES Webmaster's Guide

This website was developed mostly using:

- [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/ "Gulp Homepage") - workflow management
- [Bootstrap 3](http://getbootstrap.com/ "Bootstrap Homepage") - styling and easy mobile-first design
- [JQuery](https://jquery.com/ "JQuery Homepage") - javascript library
- [Less](http://lesscss.org/ "Less Homepage") - CSS pre-processor that streamlines css writing

Each respective site has great documentation and I would suggest using these resources (in combination with Google) for development.

Everything is pre-installed/downloaded already and maintenance is easy! The only thing you will need to install is [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/ "Node.js Homepage"). You should be pretty comfortable with basic command line as well as the basics of Github for version control.
